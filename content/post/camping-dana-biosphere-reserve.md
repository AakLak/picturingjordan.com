A few weeks ago I slept in a tent on the cusp of Jordan's Rift Valley. [Wild Jordan](http://wildjordan.com/) has regular hiking and camping trips to the reserve and they are very affordable. The staff are friendly and genuinely care about nature conservation. Trips to this and other national parks are part of an impressive [government effort](http://www.rscn.org.jo/) to preserve Jordan's natural spaces.
